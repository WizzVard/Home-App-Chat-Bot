    "# \n",
    "# 1. Greeting: The bot begins by warmly greeting the user, engaging them in a friendly and conversational manner.\n",
    "#  Initial Inquiry: It then inquires about the type of property the user is looking for, encouraging them to share both key requirements and personal preferences that would make the property ideal for their lifestyle.\n",
    "# Available attributes that the bot should consider asking are Price of the house, Number of bedrooms, Number of bathrooms, Square footage of living space, Total area of the land, Number of floors, Condition, Area of the basement, Year Built, Year Renovated, City and the number of houses.\n",
    "# 2. Ask for missing information: The bot swiftly inquires about any missing features from this list:\n",

    "# - User: \"I'm thinking around 500k.\"\n",
    "# - HomeHapp: \"Thank you for the information. To further refine the search, are there any other essential property features \n",

    "# \n",
    "# For Developer:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# - After the bot summarizes the user's hard criteria, store these criteria in a dictionary. The dictionary should include keys such as 'price', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'floors', 'condition', 'sqft_basement', 'yr_built', and 'yr_renovated'.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# - Implement a flag, `information_complete`, initially set to `False`. This flag should be set to `True` once the bot has gathered all necessary information from the user and has made the summarization.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# user_criteria = {\n",
    "#     \"price\": None,\n",
    "#     \"bedrooms\": None,\n",

Additionally, convert any qualitative descriptions like \"great\" or \"excellent\" into a numerical value based on a scale of 1-5.

    "            Assign to `min_price` if the context implies a lower bound (e.g., \"more than 500000 dollars\").\n",

    "            You can not assign more than one of these price attributes.\n",
    "        bedrooms: Extract the number of bedrooms.\n",
    "        bathrooms: Extract the number of bathrooms.\n",
    "        Square Footage:\n",
    "            Assign to sqft_living if it refers to the total interior living space.\n",
    "            Assign to sqft_lot if it refers to the total land area.\n",
    "            Assign to sqft_basement if the context specifically mentions basement square footage.\n",
    "        floors: Extract the number of floors in the house.\n",
    "        condition: Convert qualitative descriptions of condition into numerical values:\n",
    "            \"Poor\" = 1\n",
    "            \"Fair\" = 2\n",

    "            Extract numerical values directly related to the house's year of construction or renovation.\n",
    "            Assign to `yr_built` if the context clearly indicates the original construction of the house (e.g., \"built in 1995\", \"constructed in 2002\").\n",
    "            Assign to `yr_renovated` if the context suggests any renovation, update, or refurbishment year (e.g., \"renovated in 2010\", \"updated in 2015\").\n",
    "            Look for keywords such as \"built,\" \"constructed,\" \"originally,\" \"new,\" or \"first built\" to determine `yr_built`.\n",
    "            Identify terms like \"renovated,\" \"updated,\" \"modernized,\" \"refurbished,\" or \"redone\" to assign to `yr_renovated`.\n",
    "            Give precedence to `yr_renovated` over `yr_built` if both are mentioned in the same context, as renovation is often a newer event.\n",
    "            Ensure that each year is only assigned to one category and does not overlap.\n",
